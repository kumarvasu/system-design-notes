In the world of large distributed system where tens and thousands of objects and events happen, generating unique identifiers to uniquely identify them is a challenging task.  Let's dive into the requirements of unique ID generator and possible design choices.

Requirements of Unique ID generator
Uniqueness: 

1. Each generated ID must be unique.
2. 64-bit Number: The ID should be a 64-bit number, making it easy for indexing and cross-system interoperability.
3. Causality: IDs must maintain causal order, i.e., events generated in sequence should have corresponding IDs that respect the ordering (e.g., ID for event X should be smaller than ID for event Y if X happens before Y).
4. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of ID generation requests to accommodate rapid writes.
5. Availability: The system must maintain high availability, ensuring that there is no downtime.

Design Options:
1. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
   
Overview: UUIDs are 128-bit random identifiers often represented as a hexadecimal string. They can be generated independently on different machines, providing a simple and scalable solution for unique ID generation.

Uniqueness: Highly unique but with a minimal chance of collision due to randomness.

64-bit Number: Not a 64-bit number (128-bit), which can make indexing slower.
Causality: No causal ordering, as UUIDs are randomly generated.

Scalability: Extremely scalable, as any system can generate UUIDs independently without coordination.

Availability: No SPOF, highly available.

Verdict: Scalable and available but doesn't meet 64-bit or causal ordering requirements.


2. Database Auto Increment
   
Overview: Database systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL provide an auto-increment feature, where an integer ID is automatically assigned to new rows. It ensures sequential numbering in a single database instance.

Uniqueness: Not guaranteed across multiple servers, as different database instances may generate overlapping IDs.

64-bit Number: Yes, a 64-bit number, which supports fast writes and indexing.

Causality: No causal ordering, as different servers might generate IDs in an uncoordinated manner.

Scalability: Limited scalability due to the risk of ID collisions in distributed environments.

Availability: Prone to SPOF in centralized database setups.

Verdict: Fails on scalability, availability, and causality.


3. Database Auto Increment in Batches
   
Overview: This design extends the auto-increment method by assigning a unique range of IDs to each database server. New servers are given a predefined range of IDs to ensure uniqueness across a distributed system.

Uniqueness: Guarantees uniqueness, as each server operates within a designated ID range.

64-bit Number: Yes, a 64-bit number, which helps with indexing and fast writes.

Causality: No causal ordering, as IDs can be generated out of order across servers.

Scalability: More scalable than single auto-increment, as servers can independently generate unique IDs.

Availability: Improved availability, but new servers still require coordination.

Verdict: Scalable and available, but still lacks causal ordering.


4. Twitter Snowflake

Overview: The Snowflake ID generator uses a 64-bit number consisting of a timestamp (41 bits), machine ID (10 bits), and sequence number (12 bits). This structure allows for uniquely identifiable, time-ordered IDs across distributed systems.

Uniqueness: Ensures uniqueness using the combination of timestamp, machine ID, and sequence number.

64-bit Number: Yes, a 64-bit number that makes it efficient for indexing and storage.

Causality: Guarantees causal ordering, as the timestamp component ensures that IDs generated later are numerically larger.

Scalability: Highly scalable, with each machine having a unique machine ID and the ability to generate multiple IDs per millisecond.

Availability: No SPOF, as each machine can generate IDs independently.

Verdict: Meets all requirementsâ€”uniqueness, 64-bit, causality, scalability, and availability.
